# Rain Tomorrow Prediction

## Overview
This project implements a predictive model to forecast whether it will rain tomorrow based on historical weather data. The dataset used is [weather.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zaraavagyan/weathercsv), which includes various weather parameters.

## Features
- **Logistic Regression** model for predicting rainfall.
- Performance evaluation using a confusion matrix and accuracy metrics.
- Visualization of the confusion matrix as a heatmap for better interpretability.

## How to Run the Code
To run this project, follow these steps:

1. **Install Python** on your system if you haven't already.
2. **Download the dataset** (weather.csv) and place it in the same directory as the Python code.
3. **Run the code** in your command line by executing:
   ```bash
   python path/to/your/script.py
## Output
### Confusion Matrix and Accuracy
### Upon running the code, you will see the confusion matrix and accuracy displayed in the terminal.

### Heatmap of Confusion Matrix
### A heatmap visualization of the confusion matrix will also be generated for a more intuitive understanding of the model's performance.
